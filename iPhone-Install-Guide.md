## 🔍 Can't Find "Add to Home Screen"?

**If you don't see the option:**
1. Make sure you're using **Safari** (not Chrome or other browsers)
2. Make sure you opened the `index.html` file (not just viewing the folder)
3. Try scrolling down in the share menu - it might be hidden below
4. Look for these similar options:

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**If index.html won't open:**
- Make sure you're tapping the actual file, not the folder
- Try long-pressing the file and selecting "Share" → "Safari"
- Restart your iPhone and try again

**If Safari doesn't appear as an option:**
- Try tapping "More" in the app selection menu
- Look for "Open in Safari" or "Copy to Safari"

**If the app doesn't look right:**
- Make sure you opened `index.html` and not another file
- Try refreshing the page in Safari (pull down from top)

Your Washer Toss app will then work offline and function exactly like a native iPhone app! 🥏🏆
